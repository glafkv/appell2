Purpose:
	The main purpose of this project is to get familiar with using fork, exec, and shared memory. The command line needs to be able to take in 5 command line options. First, -h for a help page. -n for the max total of child processes, with the default option of 4. -s will be how many children should be allowed to exit, with the default option of 2. Then you can use -i and -o to set input and output files. 

How to Run:
	
	make
	./oss -h //shows help message
	./oss -n 4 -s 2 //lets you know that file exists
	./oss //lets you know file exists

Problems:
	A lot of them. I'm having troubles understanding shared memory completely. I keep getting lost in my code and confused about what's going on. The only good thing that came out of this was that my -h works. Everything else you will try to run, it will say "shmget: File exists". I'm not sure why. I've been working on this for weeks and weeks. I'm tired. At least it's something??

	I did use git.
